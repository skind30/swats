SoftWare Architecture Test Suite (SWATS)

This repository contains models used to test Shlaer-Mellor software
architectures.  It is specifically useful in testing an Ada model
compiler, however the models can be useful testing other aspects of
Shlaer-Mellor tooling such as ASL-to-MASL conversion.

The models are xtUML models edited in BridgePoint (and iUML).  The
action language dialect is ASL.

These models are free for use for any purpose.  Contact the committers
to learn more.
